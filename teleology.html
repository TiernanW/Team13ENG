					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p><i class="jargon">Queueing Theory</i> is a branch of mathematics. As you would imagine, in the world of the internet, a lot of information is being sent 
						and received.  We want the most efficient way to do this.  This section looks at <i class="jargon">scheduling algorithms</i> and what research is being done into them. In particular, 
						we look at research carried out at UCL, which looks at mathematical models for the behaviour of networks.</p>
					</div>

					<h2>What is a Queueing System?</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p>Just like a queue which people line up in the real world. In the computer world, packets arrive 
						a computer network, wait in various queues, receive network services, and finally exit. This 
						systematic way of treating packets is called the queueing system.</p>
						<p>Studying queueing system is important as it can greatly affect the time for a network to serve 
						devices. A badly designed system would lead to a long queue with tons of users waiting to be 
						served.</p>
						<p>Why do we use queueing systems? With hundreds of millions of devices accessing the Internet, the network does not have enough resources to serve all of them at once. 
						Queues provide buffers to store requests from devices temporarily so that the network can serve them later.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="history" class="drop-info">
					<h2>Stability of Queueing System</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p>If the packet arrival rate is less than the server capacity, the system will be stable. In 
						cases where packets are arriving at a rate higher than the server could handle, packet drop may 
						occur and delay will increase.</p>
						<p>Better hardware and software would likely result in higher server capacity. More memory 
						allocated to the server can increase its occupancy. And both can increase the stability of the 
						queueing network.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="issues" class="drop-info">
					<h2>Recent Research</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p>MIT and UCL had collaborated to study different queueing algorithms for switched networks. Depending on whether the network is lightly-loaded, critically-loaded or overloaded, 
						its performance and behavior changed accordingly. The result of the research enabled scientists to develop scheduling algorithms which work near-optimally under all three situations. 
						These algorithms can be widely applied, including wifi networks, network congestion control, and even real-world road roundabouts.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="focus" class="drop-info">
					<h2>Queueing Mechanisms</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p>There is no one queueing mechanism that works best on all situations. It is the scientistsâ€™ job to invent different mechanics for different needs. Below are some commonly seen mechanisms:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>First in first out (FIFO): the packet arrived earlier will be served before others. (1)</li>
							<li>By priority: the packet with the highest priority will be served next. (1)</li>
							<li>Weighted fair queueing: packets will be given different weights (or priorities), such that more packets with higher weight are served than others. 
							A shorter packet will often have higher priority. (3)</li>
							<li>A mixture of the above</li>
						</ul>

				<h3>Jargon Buster</h3>
				<ul class="boxed-list">
					<li><strong>Arrival Rate:</strong> The number of arrivals occuring per unit time.</li>
					<li><strong>Server Capacity:</strong> Number of packets the server can serve per unit time.</li>
					<li><strong>Occupancy:</strong> Number of packets in the queueing system (averaged over a long time).</li>
					<li><strong>Delay:</strong> Time between packet entry and exit (average of many packets).</li>
				</ul>
