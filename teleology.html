					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p><i class="jargon">Queueing Theory</i> is a branch of mathematics. As you would imagine, in the world of the internet, a lot of information is being sent 
						and received.  We want the most efficient way to do this.  This section looks at <i class="jargon">scheduling algorithms</i> and what research is being done into them. In particular, 
						we look at research carried out at UCL, which looks at mathematical models for the behaviour of networks.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="key-people" class="drop-info">
					<h2>What is a Queueing System?</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p>Just like a queue which people line up in the real world. In the computer world, packets arrive 
						a computer network, wait in various queues, receive network services, and finally exit. This 
						systematic way of treating packets is called the queueing system.</p>
						<p>Studying queueing system is important as it can greatly affect the time for a network to serve 
						devices. A badly designed system would lead to a long queue with tons of users waiting to be 
						served.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="history" class="drop-info">
					<h2>Stability of Queueing System</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p>If the packet arrival rate is less than the server capacity, the system will be stable. In 
						cases where packets are arriving at a rate higher than the server could handle, packet drop may 
						occur and delay will increase.</p>
						<p>Better hardware and software would likely result in higher server capacity. More memory 
						allocated to the server can increase its occupancy. And both can increase the stability of the 
						queueing network.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="issues" class="drop-info">
					<h2>Current Issues</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The global <i class="jargon">Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)</i> is not in an optimal state.  This table is filled with IP
							address prefixes, and some of them are more specific than others.  For example, 125.68.45 is more specific than 
							125.68.  Around half the entries in the BGP table are these more specific prefixes.  In a sense, this data could be 
							considered redundant because the less specific prefix should suffice for routing. ISPs are concerned about the rate at which the BGP is growing.</li>
							<li><strong>Slow failure recovery:</strong> The BGP does not update immediately whenever there are network failures. 
							This means that packets may be routed along the broken path for a small time frame when the network first initially 
							goes down.  This can disrupt the user experience.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="focus" class="drop-info">
					<h2>Goals and Focus</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p>UCL have proposed using a multipath-capable <i class="jargon">Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</i>.  This would work by having the sender and receiver of data packets both multihomed.  This means that they would have multiple 
						IP addresses. When they first interact, these IP addresses could all be exchanged, allowing multiple paths to be set up.  One advantage of this is that if a packet is dropped, 
						the system can respond more quickly and resend the packet on another path.</p>
						<p>UCL have also suggested that congestion should be controlled by <i>Explicit Congestion Notifications (ECN)</i> markers.  This would allow the transmission rate to incrementally steadily, 
						and once a ECN is sent, or packet loss is detected, the transmission rate could be cut.</p>

				<h3>Jargon Buster</h3>
				<ul class="boxed-list">
					<li><strong>Arrival Rate:</strong> The number of arrivals occuring per unit time.</li>
					<li><strong>Server Capacity:</strong> Number of packets the server can serve per unit time.</li>
					<li><strong>Occupancy:</strong> Number of packets in the queueing system (averaged over a long time).</li>
					<li><strong>Delay:</strong> Time between packet entry and exit (average of many packets).</li>
				</ul>
