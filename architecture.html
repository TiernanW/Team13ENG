					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p>This area of research focuses on how networks are structured.  How a network is 
						structured ultimately will affect how it performs, and decides its strengths and 
						weaknesses. It is important to note that this does not just apply to the "internet". 
						All networks must follow a structure such as those investigated below.</p>

						<img src="img/shapes.jpg" alt="network layouts">
						<p>The structure and design of a network will directly affect its properties.  Here are some of the network layouts: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Star shape: There is a central node in star shape. Itâ€™s the only relay for 
							other nodes. Star shape is easily to built up and managed. However, it is expensive 
							and unreliable, as the loss of the central node brings the whole network down.</li>
							<li>Ring shape: All nodes in the network are connected one by one to form a 
							ring shape. Data and information are transferred clockwise or anti-clockwise.</li>
							<li>Tree shape: This structure is a bit complicated. It has several levels. 
							The higher level, the more reliable the node has to be. This kind of 
							structure has low cost and can be easily expanded.</li>
							<li>Mesh shape: This is how the internet is connected, and is therefore the 
							most common.  Each node is connected randomly.  This structure means that the internet is more reliable and will not go down because of one node.</li>
						</ul>

					<h2>History</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p>The word, network first appeared in 1950s. Early computer network was used for military 
						like U.S military communication network. It has to be simple and secure so that information 
						can still be transferred when  enemy attack the network. Computer networks started to be 
						used commercially from 1960. The first widely used telecommunication network was introduced 
						by Western Electric company. Until 1973, the French CYCLADES network created reliable hosts 
						which can be used to deliver information. At that time, the network transmission speed was 
						only 50 kbit/s. The speed then increased  100 Mbit/s in 1995. By the end of 20th century, 
						the transmission speed increased to Gigabit level.</p>

				<h3>Jargon Buster</h3>
				<ul class="boxed-list">
					<li><strong>TCP:</strong> Transmission Control Protocol.  A set of rules that control how information is set over the internet.</li>
					<li><strong>BGP:</strong> Border Gateway Protocol. This is the internet's way of routing traffic through the internet by 
					connecting <i>autonomous systems</i>.  The idea is pick the shortest path.</li>
					<li><strong>Autonomous System:</strong> This is a network of computers that make up the network of the internet.  This is 
					why we refered to the internet as a "network of networks."  These sub-networks could be part of your ISP for example.</li>
					<li><strong>ECN:</strong> Explicit Congestion Notifications.  These are markers in a packet that simply indicate congestion on the path.</li>
