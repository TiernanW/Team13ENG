					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p>This area of research focuses on how networks are structured.  How a network is 
						structured ultimately will affect how it performs, and decides its strengths and 
						weaknesses. It is important to note that this does not just apply to the "internet". 
						All networks must follow a structure such as those investigated below.</p>

						<h3>UCL Research</h3>
						<h4>Shi Zhou</h4>
						<p>Shi is a professor in the department of Computer Science at UCL.  He is part of the networking research group.  More information on his research can be found under Current Research.</p>
						<h3>The Past</h3>
						<h4>Paul Baran</h4>
						<p>Paul is one of the pioneers of networking. He envisioned a network system that was not centralised (mesh) because, at the time, a nuclear war seemed likely. (2) Read more below.</p>

						<img src="img/shapes.jpg" alt="network layouts">
						<p>The structure and design of a network will directly affect its properties.  Here are some of the network layouts: </p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Star:</strong> There is a central node in star shape. Itâ€™s the only relay for 
							other nodes. Star shape is easily to built up and managed. However, it is expensive 
							and unreliable, as the loss of the central node brings the whole network down.</li>
							<li><strong>Ring:</strong> All nodes in the network are connected one by one to form a 
							ring shape. Data and information are transferred clockwise or anti-clockwise.</li>
							<li><strong>Tree:</strong> This structure is a bit complicated. It has several levels. 
							The higher level, the more reliable the node has to be. This kind of 
							structure has low cost and can be easily expanded.</li>
							<li><strong>Mesh:</strong> This is how the internet is connected, and is therefore the 
							most common.  Each node is connected randomly.  This structure means that the internet is more reliable and will not go down because of one node.</li>
						</ul>

					<h2>History</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p>The word "network" first appeared in 1950s. Early computer networks were used for U.S military communication. It had to be simple and secure so that information 
						could still be transferred when an enemy attacked the network. This is why the mesh network structure was used; a centralised network would have meant that if the central node went down, 
						then the whole network would have went down.</p>
						<p>Paul Baran envisioned a network that not centralised.  During the 1960s, one of the biggest concerns was a nuclear attack, and the systems that were in place were centralised.  Because of this, 
						they would not withstand a nuclear attack. Baran's idea also introduced the ideas of packets, which were fragments of information/data. (2)</p>
						<p>In 1972, the French CYCLADES network created reliable hosts 
						which could be used to deliver information. At that time, the network transmission speed was 
						only 50 kbit/s. The speed then increased to around 100 Mbit/s in 1995. By the end of 20th century, 
						the transmission speed increased to Gigabit level. Of course, this is not what you would receive when browsing the internet due to things like congestion and distance.</p>

					<h2>Current Research</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p>Research at UCL introduced the "rich-club" co-efficient.  The aim of this is to quantify the interconnectedness of the most well-connected nodes on the internet.  It was found that the world's 
						largest ISPs are very well connected, but social networks are not. (3)</p>
