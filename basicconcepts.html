					<h2>General Internet</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p>Say you wanted to grab a webpage from a website. If we were to watch your request, it would most likely go from your computer to your wireless access point. From the access point it 
						would go to your router which would point it to your Internet Service Provider or ISP. From there your website request would be looked up at a Domain Name Server (DNS) which simply connects 
						the name of the webpage with an internet address. Your request would then go to this internet address, possibly traversing thousands of miles of land or sea before the web page receives your 
						request. It would then send a response which your computer would get and combine to show the webpage that you requested.</p>

					<h2>OSI Model</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p>The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a model that describes the complex process of how data is transferred between computers. As you can see the data starts off at 
						the application layer where it is then deconstructed into smaller and smaller sections eventually reaching the transport layer. The data is then split into smaller sections called 
						packets which traverse the internet. However these packets are transmitted as simply binary digits and then just pulses of light as they are sent through the cables, sometimes under oceans, 
						and then reconstructed by your destination into the data you wished to send. The OSI model describes this process and it splits the process of transferring data into seven manageable layers and 
						describes how each layer contributes to the overall process of sending and receiving data. It is often shown visually in order to help people remember the layers and the order in which they 
						occur when transmitting and receiving data.</p>

					<h2>TCP and UDP</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p>Data on the internet is transferred in the form of packets and how your computer interprets these packets is  based on which protocol you use(TCP or UDP). In general TCP or 
						Transmission Control Protocol requires all packets be received in order and if a packet is missing it will request that individual packet. This is useful for when you don’t want 
						missing or dropped frames like when you are watching a movie or listening to music. The other protocol is UDP or User Datagram Protocol which allows dropped packets, which is useful 
						for streaming services like twitch where it doesn’t really matter if you miss a couple frames. </p>

					<li><strong>Server Capacity:</strong> Number of packets the server can serve per unit time.</li>
					<li><strong>Occupancy:</strong> Number of packets in the queueing system (averaged over a long time).</li>
