					<h2>History</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p>In the 1960s work was carried out on the 'ARPAnet'.  This was the predecessor to the internet and was an experimental network to share resources between universities, as a solution to a lack of funds. 
						In 1969, the first message was sent from UCLA to Stanford and simply said 'lo', but it was a start.  UCL was the first place outside of the US to have a connection to the ARPAnet.</p>
						<p>The internet became commercially available in the 1990s, and this was exciting because it was a new way for people to share information.  However, in recent years the internet has obviously become 
						very crowded, and as a result the internet slows down during congestion.  Current research aims to solve this problem.</p>
						<p><i class="jargon">TCP</i> is the protocol (set procedure) currently used to control the sending and receiving of <i class="jargon">packets</i> over the internet. It was invented by Bob Kahn 
						and Vint Cerf in the 1970s. (2) It was then in the 1980s that TCP/IP was declared as 
						standard for the US military. (2)  There have been developments since this time, but essentially it is the same protocol used today, which all popular operating systems include.</p>

					<h2>Current Issues</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The global <i class="jargon">Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)</i> is not in an optimal state.  This table is filled with IP
							address prefixes, and some of them are more specific than others.  For example, 125.68.45 is more specific than 
							125.68.  Around half the entries in the BGP table are these more specific prefixes.  In a sense, this data could be 
							considered redundant because the less specific prefix should suffice for routing. ISPs are concerned about the rate at which the BGP is growing.</li>
							<li><strong>Slow failure recovery:</strong> The BGP does not update immediately whenever there are network failures. 
							This means that packets may be routed along the broken path for a small time frame when the network first initially 
							goes down.  This can disrupt the user experience.</li>
						</ul>

					<h2>Goals and Focus</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p>UCL have proposed using a multipath-capable <i class="jargon">Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</i>.  This would work by having the sender and receiver of data packets both multihomed.  This means that they would have multiple 
						IP addresses. When they first interact, these IP addresses could all be exchanged, allowing multiple paths to be set up.  One advantage of this is that if a packet is dropped, 
						the system can respond more quickly and resend the packet on another path.</p>
						<p>UCL have also suggested that congestion should be controlled by <i>Explicit Congestion Notifications (ECN)</i> markers.  This would allow the transmission rate to incrementally steadily, 
						and once a ECN is sent, or packet loss is detected, the transmission rate could be cut.</p>

				<h3>Jargon Buster</h3>
				<ul class="boxed-list">
					<li><strong>TCP:</strong> Transmission Control Protocol.  A set of rules that control how information is set over the internet.</li>
					<li><strong>BGP:</strong> Border Gateway Protocol. This is the internet's way of routing traffic through the internet by 
					connecting <i>autonomous systems</i>.  The idea is pick the shortest path.</li>
					<li><strong>Autonomous System:</strong> This is a network of computers that make up the network of the internet.  This is 
					why we refered to the internet as a "network of networks."  These sub-networks could be part of your ISP for example.</li>
					<li><strong>ECN:</strong> Explicit Congestion Notifications.  These are markers in a packet that simply indicate congestion on the path.</li>
