					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p>We would all agree that science is a rapidly expanding field, particularly in computer science.  There have been countless achievements and advancements over the last century, and to 
						truly appreciate where we are, we must take a step into history.</p>
						<p>Computer networks emerged relatively recently, in the late 1960s, as an advancement from the telephone networks. Networks enriched the world of communications because for the first time 
						information gained in several thousand years of existence could be accessed whenever and wherever. With the 
						rapid growth of the Internet in the mid-1990s, it became clear that individuals value instant communications and free access to information.</p>
					</div>

				<div id="begin" class="drop-info">
					<h2>The Beginning</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<img src="img/1950.jpg" alt="1950s computer" class="drop-img">
						<p>The 1950s produced costly and bulky computers for privileged users only. They could occupy entire buildings and did not interact with each other. Such centralized 
						systems/mainframes produced results a day later. (1)</p>
						<p>These systems were known as "batch-processing systems".  Users of the system could insert punched paper tape into the compter that represented data and program code.  Slowly, the computer 
						would then process this and you could have a result the next day. (1)  Obviously this was too slow to be of a lot of use by today's standards.  Consider also, if you had an error in a punched 
						piece of card, the delay would therefore be 24 hours or more.  This would not be good for business.</p>

				<div id="multit" class="drop-info">
					<h2>Multi-terminal Systems</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<img src="img/terminal.jpg" alt="1950s computer" class="drop-img">
						<p>In the early 1960s processors became cheaper and multiterminal systems appeared. Each user had their own terminal for communication with the computer. This meant that in a business, there 
						could be a mainframe computer with multiple terminals connected to it.  The response time was quick, so a lot of user's would have thought it was their own terminal making the calculations. (1)</p>
						<p>The resemblance to <span class="jargon">distributed systems</span> was superficial as multiterminal systems kept the features of centralized data processing. The need for providing access to a 
						computer from remote terminals introduced the use of modems connected to telephone lines. Connections between computers enabled easier data exchange.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="wan" class="drop-info">
					<h2>The First WAN (ARPANET)</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p>Chronologically, Wide Area Networks (WANs) were the first to appear, as there was a greater need for organisations to connect far away computers. (1) In 1969, The U.S. Department of Defense joined the computers of defense and research centers into a network, 
						known as ARPANET. This was the predecessor to our now most widely known WAN: the internet. As ARPANET joined computers of different types and operating systems using common 
						communication protocols, it can be considered the first true network. It allowed not only the distribution of users, but also organised data storage. Processing 
						was distributed among computers connected by electric links. The progress of WAN depended mainly on the progress of telephone networks.</p>
						<p>One major thing that happened was the moving away from <i class="jargon">circuit-switching</i>.  This worked well for telephone networks, as this type of communication did not come and go in bursts. 
						However, computer network traffic would come and go randomly, as it is difficult to predict when information will be sent from one computer to another.  It also wasn't particularly scalable for the 
						future.  So the internet as we know it today uses <i class="jargon">packet-switching</i>.  Small data fragments were then able to travel by themselves over the network. (1)  More information on this can 
						be found on the basic concepts page.</p>

				<div id="lan" class="drop-info">
					<h2>The First LAN</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p>In the early 1970s the development of minicomputers that accomplished some tasks much faster than mainframes began. From then even small companies could enjoy having their own 
						computers. However, all computers in the same organisation still operated independently. Such isolated work no longer satisfied their needs and thus the first LAN appeared 
						(Local Area Network - a group of computers concentrated in a relatively small region).</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="pcs" class="drop-info">
					<h2>Dawn of the World Wide Web</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p>The World Wide Web (the internet as you know it), was invented by Sir Time Berners-Lee in 1989 while at CERN.  The impact of this has undoubtedly been huge, as it is what you are using right now. 
						Without his work, coupled with the work of people before him, such as Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, we would not have the internet as we know it today. (3)</p>

				<h3>Jargon Buster</h3>
				<ul class="boxed-list">
					<li><strong>Distributed System:</strong> An autonomous network of computers with co-ordinated components, allowing the sharing of software and other resources. (2)</li>
					<li><strong>Circuit Switching:</strong> A type of communication where there is a direct, dedicated connection route from one node to the other.</li>
					<li><strong>Packet Switching:</strong> A type of communication where each data fragment (packet) makes its way along various routes to reach its destination.</li>
