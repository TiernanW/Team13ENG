					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p>We would all agree that science is a rapidly expanding field, particularly in computer science.  There have been countless achievements and advancements over the last century, and to 
						truly appreciate where we are, we must take a step into history.</p>
						<p>Computer networks emerged relatively recently, in the late 1960s as an advancement from the telephone networks. One way to illustrate this is the ancient example of a 
						network covering large areas for multiple clients: the water-supply system in ancient Rome. Using the same principle, a group of computers operate and coordinate by exchanging data.</p>
						<p>Networks enriched the world of communications because for the first time information gained in several thousand years of existence could be accessed whenever and wherever. With the 
						rapid growth of the Internet in the mid-1990s, it became clear that individuals value instant communications and free anonymous access to information.</p>

					<h2>The Beginning</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<img src="img/1950.jpg" alt="1950s computer" class="drop-img">
						<p>The 1950s produced bulky expensive computers for privileged users only. They could occupy entire buildings and did not interact with each other. Such centralized 
						systems based on mainframes produced results a day later as printouts and errors would cause great delays.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="multit" class="drop-info">
					<h2>Multi-terminal Systems</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<img src="img/terminal.jpg" alt="1950s computer" class="drop-img">
						<p>In the early 1960s processors became cheaper and multiterminal systems appeared. Each user had their own terminal for communication with the computer. Gradually, 
						terminals moved out of computer centers and onto desktops over entire organizations.</p>
						<p>The resemblance to distributed systems was superficial as multiterminal systems kept the features of centralized data processing. The need for providing access to a 
						computer from remote terminals introduced the use of modems connected to telephone lines. Connections between computers enabled data exchange in automatic mode. Developers of 
						the first networks implemented services for file exchange, database synchronization, e-mail, and more.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="wan" class="drop-info">
					<h2>The First WAN (ARPANet)</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p>Chronologically, Wide Area Networks (WANs) were the first to appear. In 1969, The U.S. Department of Defense joined the computers of defense and research centers into a network, 
						also known as ARPANET. This was the predecessor to our now most widely known WAN: the internet. As ARPANET joined computers of different types and operating systems using common 
						communication protocols, it can be considered the first true network operating system. It allowed not only the distribution of users but also organised data storage. Processing 
						was distributed among computers connected by electric links. The progress of WAN depended mainly on the progress of telephone networks.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="lan" class="drop-info">
					<h2>The First LAN</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<p>In the early 1970s the development of minicomputers that accomplished some tasks much faster than mainframes began. From then even small companies could enjoy having their own 
						computers. However, all computers in the same organisation still operated independently. Such isolated work no longer satisfied the needs and thus the first LAN appeared 
						(Local Area Network - a group of computers concentrated in a relatively small region).</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="pcs" class="drop-info">
					<h2>Dawn of Personal Computing</h2>
					<div class="expanse">
						<img src="img/pc.jpg" alt="1950s computer" class="drop-img">
						<p>Personal computers (PCs) provided the ideal elements for building networks. They were not only playing the role of clients but also performing data storage and processing 
						center functions. Eventually, PCs became more popular and forced minicomputers and mainframes out of these roles.</p>
